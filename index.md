## Introduction

Signed languages (also known as sign languages) are languages that use the visual-gestural modality to convey meaning through manual articulations in combination with non-manual elements like the face and body.
Similar to spoken languages, signed languages are natural languages governed by a set of linguistic rules [@sandler2006sign], 
both emerging through an abstract, protracted aging process and evolved without meticulous planning.
Signed languages are not universal, or mutually intelligible, despite often having striking similarities among them.
They are also distinct from spoken languages---i.e., American Sign Language (ASL) is not a visual form of English, 
rather its own unique language.

Sign Language Processing [@bragg2019sign;@yin-etal-2021-including] is an emerging field of artificial intelligence concerned with the automatic processing and analysis of sign language content.
It is a subfield of both natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV).
Challenges in sign language processing frequently involve machine translation of sign language videos to spoken language text (sign language translation), 
from spoken language text (sign language production), or sign language recognition for sign language understanding.

Unfortunately, the latest advances in language-based artificial intelligence, like machine translation and personal assistants, 
expect a spoken language input (text or transcribed speech), which excludes around 200 different signed languages and up to 70 million deaf people (According to the [World Federation of the Deaf](https://wfdeaf.org/our-work/)). 

One of the challenging aspects regarding the translation of signed languages compared to spoken languages is that
while spoken languages usually have agreed upon written forms, signed languages do not.
The lack of a written form makes the spoken language processing pipelines - which often start with audio-transcription before processing - 
incompatible with signed languages, forcing researchers to work directly on the raw video signal.

In this work, we describe the different representations used for sign language processing, 
as well as survey the various tasks and recent advances on them.
We also make a comprehensive list of existing datasets and make the ones available easy to load using a simple and standardized interface.


## Sign Language Representations

As signed languages are conveyed through the visual-gestural modality, the most straightforward way to capture them is via video recording.
However, as videos include more information than needed for modeling, and are expensive to record, store, and transmit, a lower-dimensionality representation has been sought after.

One such representation is human [poses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pose_(computer_vision)), either recorded with [motion capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture) technologies,
or estimated from videos using [pose estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pose_(computer_vision)#Pose_estimation) techniques.
Accurate full-body human poses can include all the relevant information for sign language processing (manual or non-manual), except for visual cues such as props.

Another representation system is sign language notation. Despite the fact that several notation systems have been proposed to capture the phonetics of signed languages, 
no writing system has been adopted widely enough by any sign language community that it could be considered the "written form" of a given sign language. 
There are various universal notation systems---[SignWriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SignWriting) [@writing:sutton1990lessons], 
[HamNoSys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg_Notation_System) [@writing:prillwitz1990hamburg]---and various language specific notation systems---[Stokoe notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokoe_notation) 
[@writing:stokoe2005sign] and [si5s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si5s) for American Sign Language, [SWL](https://zrajm.github.io/teckentranskription/freesans-swl.html) [@writing:bergman1977tecknad] 
for Swedish Sign Language, etc.

Making an abstraction over the phonetics of sign language, glossing is a widely used practice to "transcribe" a video sign-by-sign by assigning a unique identifier for every sign and possibly every variation of it. 
Unlike other representations previously discussed, as glosses represent the semantics of sign, they are language-specific, requiring a new glossary for every sign language.


The following table exemplifies the various representations for isolated signs.
For this example, we use [SignWriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SignWriting) as the notation system.
Note that the same sign might have two unrelated glosses, and the same gloss might have multiple valid spoken language translations.

We also demonstrate the various representations in the following figure for a continuous sign language video. 
To show the alignment of the annotations between the video and representations, we deconstruct the video into its individual frames.
An English translation of this phrase could be: "What is your name?"

## Tasks

### Sign Language Detection

Sign language detection [@detection:borg2019sign;@detection:moryossef2020real] is defined as the binary classification for any
given frame of a video whether a person is using sign language or not.

@detection:borg2019sign introduced the classification of frames taken from YouTube videos as either signing or not. 
They take a spatial and temporal approach based on VGG-16 [@simonyan2015very] CNN to encode each frame 
and use a [GRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_recurrent_unit) [@cho2014learning] 
to encode the sequence of frames in a window of 20 frames at 5fps.
In addition to the raw frame, they also either encode optical flow history, aggregated motion history, or frame difference.

@detection:moryossef2020real improved upon their method by performing sign language detection in real-time.
They identified that sign language use involves movement of the body, and as such, designed a model that works on top of 
estimated human poses rather than directly on the video signal.
They calculate the optical flow norm of every joint detected on the body and apply a shallow yet effective contextualized model
to predict for every frame whether the person is signing or not.

While these works perform well on this task, well-annotated data, including interferences and distractors, is still lacking for real-world evaluation.

### Sign Language Identification

Sign language identification [@identification:gebre2013automatic;@identification:monteiro2016detecting] is defined as the classification between two or more signed languages.
 
@identification:gebre2013automatic found that a simple random-forest classifier can distinguish between British Sign Language (BSL) and Greek Sign Language (ENN) with a 95% F1 score.
This finding is further supported by @identification:monteiro2016detecting, which manages to differentiate between British Sign Language and 
French Sign Language (Langue des Signes Fran√ßaise, LSF) with 98% F1 score in videos with static backgrounds, 
and between American Sign Language and British Sign Language with 70% F1 score for videos mined from popular video sharing sites. 
The authors attribute their success mainly to the different fingerspelling systems, which is two-handed in the case of BSL and one-handed in the case of ASL and LSF.


### Sign Language Segmentation

Segmentation consists of detecting the frame boundaries for signs or phrases in videos to divide them into meaningful units.
While the most canonical way of dividing a spoken language text is into a linear sequence of words, 
due to the simultaneity of sign language, the notion of a sign language "word" is ill-defined, and sign language cannot be fully modeled linearly.

Current methods resort to segmenting units loosely mapped to signed language units [@segmentation:santemiz2009automatic;@segmentation:farag2019learning;@segmentation:bull2020automatic;@segmentation:renz2021signa;@segmentation:renz2021signb;@segmentation:bull2021aligning], 
and do not leverage reliable linguistic predictors of sentence boundaries such as prosody in signed languages (i.e. pauses, sign duration, facial expressions, eye apertures) \cite{sandler2010prosody, ormel2012prosodic}.

@segmentation:santemiz2009automatic automatically extract isolated signs from continuous signing by aligning the sequences obtained via speech recognition, modeled by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) approaches. 

@segmentation:farag2019learning use a random forest classifier to distinguish frames containing words in Japanese Sign Language based on the composition of spatio-temporal angular and distance features betweeen domain-specific pairs of joint segments.

@segmentation:bull2020automatic segment French Sign Language into subtitle-units by detecting the temporal boundaries of subtitles aligned with sign language videos, leveraging a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network with a BiLSTM on 2D skeleton data.

@segmentation:renz2021signa determine the location of temporal boundaries between signs in continuous sign language videos by employing 3D convolutional neural network representations with iterative temporal segment refinement to resolve ambiguities between sign boundary cues. @segmentation:renz2021signb further propose the Changepoint-Modulated Pseudo-Labelling (CMPL) algorithm to solve the problem of source-free domain
adaptation. 

@segmentation:bull2021aligning present a Transformer-based approach to segment sign language video content and align with subtitles at the same time, encoding subtitles by BERT and videos by CNN video representations.


### Sign Language Recognition, Translation, and Production

Sign language translation is generally considered the task of translating between a video in sign language to spoken language text.
Sign language production is the reverse process of producing a sign language video from spoken language text.
Sign language recognition [@adaloglou2020comprehensive] is the task of recognizing the discrete signs themselves in sign language (glosses).

In the following graph, we can see a fully connected pentagon where each node is a single data representation, 
and each directed edge represents the task of converting between one data representation to another.

We split the graph into two: 

- Every edge to the left, on the orange background, represents a task in computer vision. These tasks are inherently language-agnostic, thus generalize between signed languages.
- Every edge to the right, on the blue background, represents a task in natural language processing. These tasks are sign language-specific, requiring a specific sign language lexicon or spoken language tokens.
- Every edge on both backgrounds represents a task requiring a combination of computer vision and natural language processing.

In total, there are 20 tasks conceptually defined by this graph, with varying amounts of previous research.
Every path between two nodes might or might not be valid, depending on how lossy the tasks in the path are.

#### Video-to-Pose

Video-to-Pose---commonly known as pose estimation---is the task to detect human figures in images and videos, 
so that one could determine, for example, where someone's elbow shows up in an image.
It was shown [@vogler2005analysis] that the face pose correlates with facial non-manual features like head direction.

This area has been thoroughly researched [@pose:pishchulin2012articulated;@pose:chen2017adversarial;@pose:cao2018openpose;@pose:alp2018densepose]
with objectives varying from predicting 2D / 3D poses to a selection of a small specific set of landmarks or a dense mesh of a person.

OpenPose [@pose:cao2018openpose;@pose:simon2017hand;@pose:cao2017realtime;@pose:wei2016cpm] is the first multi-person system to 
jointly detect human body, hand, facial, and foot keypoints (in total 135 keypoints) in 2D on single images.
While their model can estimate the full pose directly from an image in a single inference,
they also suggest a pipeline approach where first they estimate the body pose and then independently estimate 
the hands and face pose by acquiring higher resolution crops around those areas.
Building on the slow pipeline approach, a single network whole body OpenPose model has been proposed [@pose:hidalgo2019singlenetwork], 
which is faster and more accurate for the case of obtaining all keypoints.
Additionally, with multiple angles of recording, OpenPose also offers keypoint triangulation in order to reconstruct the pose in 3D.

@pose:alp2018densepose takes a different approach with DensePose. 
Instead of classifying for every keypoint which pixel is most likely, they suggest similarly to semantic segmentation,
for each pixel to classify which body part it belongs to.
Then, for each pixel, knowing the body part, they predict where that pixel is on the body part relative to a 2D projection of a representative body model.
This approach results in the reconstruction of the full-body mesh and allows sampling to find specific keypoints similar to OpenPose.

However, 2D human poses might not be sufficient to fully understand the position and orientation of landmarks in space,
and applying pose estimation per-frame does not take the video temporal movement information into account, 
especially in cases of rapid movement, which contain motion blur.

@pose:pavllo20193d developed two methods to convert between 2D poses to 3D poses. 
The first, a supervised method, was trained to use the temporal information between frames to predict the missing Z-axis.
The second, an unsupervised method, leveraging the fact that the 2D poses are merely a projection of an unknown 3D pose
and train a model to estimate the 3D pose and back-project to the input 2D poses. This back-projection is a deterministic process, 
and as such, it applies constraints on the 3D pose encoder. 
@pose:zelinka2020neural follow a similar process and adds a constraint for bones to stay of a fixed length between frames.

@pose:panteleris2018using suggest converting the 2D poses to 3D using inverse kinematics (IK), a process taken from computer animation and robotics to calculate the variable joint parameters needed to place the end of a kinematic chain, 
such as a robot manipulator or animation character's skeleton in a given position and orientation relative to the start of the chain.
Demonstrating their approach on hand pose estimation, they manually explicitly encode the constraints and limits of each joint, resulting in 26 degrees of freedom.
Then, non-linear least-squares minimization fits a 3D model of the hand to the estimated 2D joint positions, recovering the 3D hand pose.
This is similar to the back-projection used by @pose:pavllo20193d, except here, no temporal information is being used.

MediaPipe Holistic [@mediapipe2020holistic] attempts to solve the 3D pose estimation problem directly by taking a similar approach to OpenPose,
having a pipeline system to estimate the body and then the face and hands. Unlike OpenPose, the estimated poses are in 3D,
and the pose estimator runs in real-time on CPU, allowing for pose-based sign language models on low powered mobile devices.
This pose estimation tool is widely available and built for Android, iOS, C++, Python, and the Web using Javascript.


#### Pose-to-Video

Pose-to-Video, also known as motion-transfer or skeletal animation in the field of robotics and animation, is the
conversion of a sequence of poses to a realistic-looking video.
For sign language production, this is the final "rendering" to make the produced sign language look human.

@pose:chan2019everybody demonstrates a semi-supervised approach where they take a set of videos, 
run pose-estimation with OpenPose [@pose:cao2018openpose], and learn an image-to-image translation [@isola2017image]
between the rendered skeleton and the original video.
They demonstrate their approach on human dancing, where they can extract poses from a choreography, 
and render any person as if they were dancing that dance.
They predict two consecutive frames for temporally coherent video results and 
introduce a separate pipeline for a more realistic face synthesis, although still flawed.

@pose:wang2018vid2vid suggest a similar method using DensePose [@pose:alp2018densepose] representations 
in addition to the OpenPose [@pose:cao2018openpose] ones. 
They formalize a different model, with various objectives to optimize for such as background-foreground separation and
temporal coherence by using the previous two timestamps in the input.

Using the same method by @pose:chan2019everybody on "Everybody Dance Now", @pose:girocan2020slrtp asks, "Can Everybody Sign Now"?
They evaluate the generated videos by asking signers various tasks after watching them and comparing the signers' ability to
perform these tasks on the original videos, rendered pose videos, and reconstructed videos.
They show that subjects prefer synthesized realistic videos over skeleton visualizations, 
and that out-of-the-box synthesis methods are not really effective enough, 
as subjects struggled to understand the reconstructed videos.

As a direct response, @saunders2020everybody shows that like in @pose:chan2019everybody, 
where an adversarial loss is added to specifically generate the face, adding a similar loss to the hand generation process
yields high resolution, more photo-realistic continuous sign language videos.

[Deepfakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake) is a technique to replace a person in an 
existing image or video with someone else's likeness [@nguyen2019deep]. 
This technique can be used to improve the unrealistic face synthesis, resulting from not face-specialized models,
or even replace cartoon faces from animated 3D models.

#### Pose-to-Gloss
Pose-to-Gloss---also known as sign language recognition---is the task of recognizing a sequence of signs from a sequence of poses.

<span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span>

#### Gloss-to-Pose

Gloss-to-Pose---also known as sign language production---is the task to produce a sequence of poses that adequately represent
a sequence of signs written as gloss.

To produce a sign language video, @stoll2018sign constructs a lookup-table between glosses and sequences of 2D poses.
They align all pose sequences at the neck joint of a reference skeleton and group all sequences belonging to the same gloss.
Then, for each group, they apply dynamic time warping and average out all sequences in the group to construct the mean pose sequence.
This approach suffers from not having an accurate set of poses aligned to the gloss and from unnatural motion transitions between glosses.

To alleviate the downsides of the previous work, @stoll2020text2sign constructs a lookup-table of gloss to a group of sequences of poses rather than creating a mean pose sequence.
They build a Motion Graph [@min2012motion] - which is a Markov process that can be used to generate new motion sequences that are representative of real motion,
and select the motion primitives (sequence of poses) per gloss with the highest transition probability.
To smooth that sequence and reduce unnatural motion, they use Savitzky‚ÄìGolay motion transition smoothing filter [@savitzky1964smoothing].


---

#### Video-to-Gloss
Video-to-Gloss---also known as sign language recognition---is the task of recognizing a sequence of signs from a video.

For this recognition, @cui2017recurrent constructs a three-step optimization model.
First, they train a video-to-gloss end-to-end model, where they encode the video using a spatio-temporal CNN encoder, 
and predict the gloss using a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) [@graves2006connectionist].
Then, from the CTC alignment and category proposal, they encode each gloss-level segment independently, trained to predict the gloss category,
and use this gloss video segments encoding to optimize the sequence learning model. 

@cihan2018neural fundamentally differ from that approach and opt to formulate this problem as if it is a natural-language translation problem.
They encode each video frame using AlexNet [@krizhevsky2012imagenet], initialized using weights that were trained on ImageNet [@deng2009imagenet].
Then they apply a GRU encoder-decoder architecture with Luong Attention [@luong2015effective] to generate the gloss.
In follow-up work, @camgoz2020sign use a transformer encoder [@vaswani2017attention] to replace the GRU 
and use a CTC to decode the gloss. They show a slight improvement with this approach on the video-to-gloss task.

```{=ignore}
<span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span> @camgoz2017subunets SubUNets
Camgoz et. al [26] introduce a DNN-based approach for
solving the simultaneous alignment and recognition problems,
typically referred to as "sequence-to-sequence" learning. In
particular, the overall problem is decomposed of a series
of specialized systems, termed SubUNets. The overall goal
is to model the spatio-temporal relationships among these
SubUNets to solve the task at hand. More specifically, SubUNets allow to inject domain-specific expert knowledge into
the system regarding suitable intermediate representations.
Additionally, they also allow to implicitly perform transfer
learning between different interrelated tasks.

<span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span> @cui2019deep GoogLeNet + TConvs
In contrast to other 2D CNN-based methods that employ
HMMs, Cui et. al [25] propose a model that includes an
extra temporal module (TConvs), after the feature extractor
(GoogLeNet). The TConvs module consists of two 1D CNN
layers and two max pooling layers. It is designed to capture
the fine-grained dependencies, which exist inside a gloss
(intra-gloss dependencies) between consecutive frames, into
compact per-window feature vectors. Finally, bidirectional
RNNs are applied in order to capture the long-term temporal
dependencies of the entire sentence. The total architecture is
trained iteratively, in order to exploit the expressive capability
of DNN models with limited data.

<span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span> @dataset:joze2018ms I3D
Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) [@carreira2017quo] was originally developed
for the task of human action recognition; however, its application has demonstrated outstanding performance on isolated SLR [42]. In particular, the I3D architecture is an
extended version of GoogLeNet, which contains several 3D
convolutional layers followed by 3D max-pooling layers. The
key insight of this architecture is the endowing of the 2D
sub-modules (filters and pooling kernels) with an additional
temporal dimension. This methodology makes feasible to
learn spatio-temporal features from videos, while it leverages
efficient known architecture designs and parameters.

<span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span> @pu2019iterative 3D ResNet+LSTM
Pu et al. [45] propose a framework comprising a 3D CNN
for feature extraction, a RNN for sequence learning and
two different decoding strategies, one performed with CTC
and the other with an attentional decoder RNN. The glosses
predicted by the attentional decoder are utilised to draw a
warping path using a soft-DTW [47] alignment constraint.
The warping paths display the alignments between glosses
and video segments. The proposed pseudo-alignments are then
employed for iterative optimization.
```

@adaloglou2020comprehensive perform a comparative experimental assessment of computer vision-based methods for the video-to-gloss task.
They implement various approaches from previous research [@camgoz2017subunets;@cui2019deep;@dataset:joze2018ms]
and test them on multiple datasets [@dataset:huang2018video;@cihan2018neural;@dataset:von2007towards;@dataset:joze2018ms]
either for isolated sign recognition or continuous sign recognition.
They conclude that 3D convolutional models outperform models using only recurrent networks to capture the temporal information,
and that these models are more scalable given the restricted receptive field, which results from the CNN "sliding window" technique.

#### Gloss-to-Video
Gloss-to-Video---also known as sign language production---is the task to produce a video that adequately represents
a sequence of signs written as gloss.

As of 2020, there is no research discussing the direct translation task between a gloss to video.
We believe this is a result of the computational impracticality of the desired model, 
which led researchers to avoid performing this task directly and instead rely on pipeline approaches using intermediate pose representations.


---

#### Gloss-to-Text
Gloss-to-Text---also known as sign language translation---is the natural language processing task of translating
between gloss text representing sign language signs and spoken language text. 
These texts commonly differ by terminology, capitalization, and sentence structure.

@cihan2018neural experimented with various machine-translation architectures and compared between using an LSTM vs. GRU for the recurrent model,
as well as Luong attention [@luong2015effective] vs. Bahdanau attention [@bahdanau2014neural], and various batch-sizes. 
They concluded that on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, which was also presented by this work, 
using GRUs, Luong attention, and a batch size of 1 outperforms all other configurations.

In parallel with the advancements in spoken language machine translation, 
@yin2020better proposed replacing the RNN with a Transformer [@vaswani2017attention] encoder-decoder model, showing improvements on both
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (DGS) and ASLG-PC12 (ASL) datasets both using a single model and ensemble of models.
Interestingly, in gloss-to-text, they show that using the sign language recognition (video-to-gloss) system output outperforms using the gold annotated glosses.

Building on the code published by @yin2020better, @todo <span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span> show it is beneficial to pre-train these translation models
using augmented monolingual spoken language corpora.
They try three different approaches for data augmentation: 
(1) Back-translation; 
(2) General text-to-gloss rules, including lemmatization, word reordering, and dropping of words; 
(3) Language pair specific rules that augment the spoken language syntax to its corresponding sign language syntax.
When pretraining, all augmentations show improvements over the baseline for both RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (DGS) and NCSLGR (ASL). 


#### Text-to-Gloss
Text-to-gloss---also knows as sign language translation---is the task to translate between a spoken language text and sign language glosses.

@zhao2000machine used a Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) based system for translating between English sentences and American Sign Language glosses.
They parse the English text and simultaneously assemble an American Sign Language gloss tree, using Synchronous TAGs [@shieber1990synchronous;@shieber1994restricting], 
by associating the ASL elementary trees with the English elementary trees and associating the nodes at which subsequent substitutions or adjunctions can take place.
Synchronous TAGs have been used for machine translation between spoken languages [@abeille1991using], but this is the first application to a signed language.

For the automatic translation of gloss-to-text, @dataset:othman2012english identified the need for a large parallel sign language gloss and spoken language text corpus.
They develop a part-of-speech based grammar to transform English sentences taken from the Gutenberg Project ebooks collection [@lebert2008project] into American Sign Language gloss.
Their final corpus contains over 100 million synthetic sentences and 800 million words and is the largest English-ASL gloss corpus that we know of.
Unfortunately, it is hard to attest to the quality of the corpus, as they didn't evaluate their method on real English-ASL gloss pairs, and only a small sample of this corpus is available online.

---

#### Video-to-Text
Video-to-text---also knows as sign language translation---is the entire task of translating a raw video to spoken language text.

@camgoz2020sign proposed a single architecture to perform this task that can use both the sign language gloss and 
the spoken language text in joint-supervision.
They use the pre-trained spatial embeddings from @koller2019weakly to encode each frame independently and encode the frames with a transformer.
On this encoding, they use a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) [@graves2006connectionist] to classify the sign language gloss.
Using the same encoding, they also use a transformer decoder to decode the spoken language text one token at a time.
They show that adding gloss supervision improves the model over not using it and that it outperforms previous video-to-gloss-to-text pipeline approaches [@cihan2018neural].

Following up, @camgoz2020multi propose a new architecture that does not require the supervision of glosses, called
"Multi-channel Transformers for Multi-articulatory Sign Language Translation".
In this approach, they crop the signing hand and the face and perform 3D pose estimation to obtain three separate data channels.
They encode each data channel separately using a transformer, then encode all channels together and concatenate the separate channels for each frame.
Like their previous work, they use a transformer decoder to decode the spoken language text, but unlike their previous work,
do not use the gloss as additional supervision. 
Instead, they add two "anchoring" losses to predict the hand shape and mouth shape from each frame independently, 
as silver annotations are available to them using the model proposed in @koller2019weakly.
They conclude that this approach is on-par with previous approaches requiring glosses, 
and so they have broken the dependency upon costly annotated gloss information in the video-to-text task.


#### Text-to-Video
Text-to-Video---also known as sign language production---is the task to produce a video that adequately represents
a spoken language text in sign language.

As of 2020, there is no research discussing the direct translation task between text to video.
We believe this is a result of the computational impracticality of the desired model,
which led researchers to avoid performing this task directly and instead rely on pipeline approaches using intermediate pose representations.

---

#### Pose-to-Text
Pose-to-text---also knows as sign language translation---is the task of translating a captured or estimated pose sequence to spoken language text.

@dataset:ko2019neural demonstrate impressive performance on the pose-to-text task by inputting the pose sequence into a
standard encoder-decoder translation network. 
They experiment both with GRU and various types of attention [@luong2015effective;@bahdanau2014neural] and with a Transformer [@vaswani2017attention],
and show similar performance, with the transformer underperforming on the validation set and overperforming on the test set, which consists of unseen signers.
They experiment with various normalization scheme, mainly subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of every individual keypoint
either with respect to the entire frame or to the relevant "object" (Body, Face, and Hand).

#### Text-to-Pose
Text-to-Pose---also known as sign language production---is the task to produce a sequence of poses that adequately represent
a spoken language text in sign language.

@saunders2020progressive propose Progressive Transformers, a model to translate from 
discrete spoken language sentences to continuous 3D sign pose sequences in an autoregressive manner.
Unlike symbolic transformers [@vaswani2017attention], which use a discrete vocabulary and thus can 
predict an end-of-sequence (`EOS`) token in every step, the progressive transformer predicts a 
$counter ‚àà [0,1]$ in addition to the pose.
In inference time, $counter=1$ is considered as the end of the sequence.
They test their approach on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset using OpenPose 2D pose estimation,
uplifted to 3D [@pose:zelinka2020neural], and show favorable results when evaluating using back-translation 
from the generated poses to spoken language.
They further show [@saunders2020adversarial] that using an adversarial discriminator between 
the ground truth poses, and the generated poses, conditioned on the input spoken language text 
improves the production quality as measured using back-translation.

To overcome the issues of under-articulation seen in the above works, 
@saunders2020everybody expands on the progressive transformer model using a 
Mixture Density Network (MDN) [@bishop1994mixture] to model the variation found in sign language.
While this model underperforms on the validation set, compared to previous work, it outperforms on the test set.

@pose:zelinka2020neural present a similar autoregressive decoder approach, with added dynamic-time-warping (DTW) and soft attention.
They test their approach on Czech Sign Language weather data extracted from the news, which is not manually annotated,
or aligned to the spoken language captions, and show their DTW is advantageous for this kind of task.

@xiao2020skeleton close the loop by proposing a text-to-pose-to-text model for the case of isolated sign language recognition.
They first train a classifier to take a sequence of poses encoded by a BiLSTM and classify the relevant sign,
then, propose a production system to take a single sign and sample a constant length sequence of 50 poses from a Gaussian Mixture Model.
These components are combined such that given a sign class $y$, a pose sequence is generated, then classified back into a sign class $≈∑$,
and the loss is applied between $y$ and $≈∑$, and not directly on the generated pose sequence.
They evaluate their approach on the CSL dataset [@dataset:huang2018video] and show that their generated pose sequences 
almost reach the same classification performance as the real sequences.

### Fingerspelling 

Fingerspelling is the act of spelling a word letter-by-letter, borrowing from the spoken language alphabet [@battison1978lexical;@wilcox1992phonetics;@brentari2001language].
This phenomenon, found in most signed languages, often occurs when there is no previously agreed upon sign for a concept,
like in technical language, colloquial conversations involving names, conversations involving current events, 
emphatic forms, and the context of code-switching between the sign language and corresponding spoken language [@padden1998asl;@montemurro2018emphatic].
The relative amount of fingerspelling varies between signed languages, and for American Sign Language (ASL) accounts for 12‚Äì35% of the signed content [@padden2003alphabet].

@patrie2011fingerspelled describe the following terminology to describe three different forms of fingerspelling:

- **Careful**---slower spelling where each letter pose is clearly formed.
- **Rapid**---quick spelling where letters are often not completed and contain remnants of other letters in the word.
- **Lexicalized**---a sign produced by often using no more than two letter-hand-shapes [@battison1978lexical].<br>
For example, lexicalized `ALL` uses `A` and `L`, lexicalized `BUZZ` uses `B` and `Z`, etc...

#### Recognition
Fingerspelling recognition--a sub-task of sign language recognition--is the task to recognize fingerspelled words from a sign language video.

@dataset:fs18slt introduced a large dataset available for American Sign Language fingerspelling recognition.
This dataset includes both the "careful" and "rapid" forms of fingerspelling collected from naturally occurring videos "in the wild", which are more challenging than studio conditions.
They train a baseline model to take a sequence of images cropped around the signing hand and either use an autoregressive decoder or a CTC.
They found that the CTC outperforms the autoregressive decoder model, but both achieve a very low recognition rate (35-41% character level accuracy) compared to human performance (around 82%).

In follow-up work, @dataset:fs18iccv collected nearly an order-of-magnitude larger dataset and designed a new recognition model.
Instead of detecting the signing hand, they detect the face and crop a large area around it. 
Then, they perform an iterative process of zooming in to the hand using visual attention in order to retain sufficient information in high resolution of the hand.
Finally, like their previous work, they encode the image hand crops sequence and use a CTC to obtain the frame labels.
They show that this method outperforms their original "hand crop" method by 4%, 
and that using the additional data collected, they can achieve up to 62.3% character level accuracy.
Looking through this dataset, we note that the videos in the dataset are taken from longer videos, and as they are cut, they do not retain the signing before the fingerspelling.
This context relates to language modeling, where at first one fingerspells a word carefully, and when repeating it, might fingerspell it rapidly, 
but the interlocutors can infer they are fingerspelling the same word.

#### Production

Fingerspelling production--a sub-task of sign language production--is the task of producing a fingerspelling video for words.

In its most basic form, "Careful" fingerspelling production can be trivially solved using pre-defined letter handshapes interpolation.
@adeline2013fingerspell demonstrates this approach for American Sign Language and English fingerspelling.
They rig a hand armature for each letter in the English alphabet ($N=26$) and generate all ($N^2=676$) transitions between every two letters using interpolation or manual animation.
Then, to fingerspell full words, they chain pairs of letter transitions.
For example, for the word "CHLOE", they would chain the following transitions sequentially: `#C` `CH` `HL` `LO` `OE` `E#`.

However, to produce life-like animations, one must also consider the rhythm and speed of holding letters, and transitioning between letters, 
as those can affect how intelligible fingerspelling motions are to an interlocutor (@wilcox1992phonetics).
@wheatland2016analysis analyzes both "careful" and "rapid" fingerspelling videos for these features. 
They find that for both forms of fingerspelling, on average, the longer the word, the shorter the transition and hold time.
Furthermore, they find that less time is spent on middle letters on average, and the last letter is held on average longer than the other letters in the word.
Finally, they use this information to construct an animation system using letter pose interpolation and control the timing using a data-driven statistical model.

## Existing Datasets

Currently, there is no easy way or agreed upon format to download and load sign language datasets, and as such, evaluation on these datasets is scarce.
As part of this work, we streamlined the loading of available datasets using [Tensorflow Datasets](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets) [@TFDS].
This allows researchers to load large and small datasets alike with a simple command and be comparable to other works.
We make these datasets available using a custom library, [Sign Language Datasets](https://github.com/sign-language-processing/datasets).

```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
import sign_language_datasets.datasets

# Loading a dataset with default configuration
aslg_pc12 = tfds.load("aslg_pc12")

# Loading a dataset with custom configuration
from sign_language_datasets.datasets.config import SignDatasetConfig
config = SignDatasetConfig(name="videos_and_poses256x256:12", 
                           version="3.0.0",          # Specific version
                           include_video=True,       # Download and load dataset videos
                           fps=12,                   # Load videos at constant, 12 fps
                           resolution=(256, 256),    # Convert videos to a constant resolution, 256x256
                           include_pose="holistic")  # Download and load Holistic pose estimation
rwth_phoenix2014_t = tfds.load(name='rwth_phoenix2014_t', builder_kwargs=dict(config=config))
```

Furthermore, we follow a unified interface when possibles, making attributes the same and comparable between datasets:
```python
{
    "id": tfds.features.Text(),
    "signer": tfds.features.Text() | tf.int32,
    "video": tfds.features.Video(shape=(None, HEIGHT, WIDTH, 3)),
    "depth_video": tfds.features.Video(shape=(None, HEIGHT, WIDTH, 1)),
    "fps": tf.int32,
    "pose": {
        "data": tfds.features.Tensor(shape=(None, 1, POINTS, CHANNELS), dtype=tf.float32),
        "conf": tfds.features.Tensor(shape=(None, 1, POINTS), dtype=tf.float32)
    },
    "gloss": tfds.features.Text(),
    "text": tfds.features.Text()
}
```
